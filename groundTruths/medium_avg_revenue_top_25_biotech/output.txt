I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the average revenue of the top 25 biotechnology stocks by market cap, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to identify the top 25 biotechnology stocks by market cap. This will involve joining the `stockindustries` and `price_data` tables to filter for biotechnology companies and get their most recent market cap.
2. Join the result of step 1 with the `earnings` table to get the most recent revenue data for these companies.
3. Calculate the average revenue for these top 25 biotechnology stocks.
4. Ensure we're using the most recent data available for both market cap and revenue.
5. Filter for biotechnology stocks using the `biotechnology` field in the `stockindustries` table.
6. Use appropriate aggregation functions (MAX for market cap and date, MAX for revenue to get the most recent value) to avoid errors related to non-aggregated columns.
7. Group by symbol in subqueries to ensure we're getting one entry per company and avoiding duplicates.
8. Include all relevant fields: symbol, name, market cap, revenue, and dates in the results.
9. Order the results by market cap descending to show the top biotechnology stocks first.
10. Limit the inner query to 25 results to get only the top 25 biotechnology stocks by market cap.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH top_biotech AS (SELECT si.symbol, si.name, MAX(pd.marketCap) AS marketCap, MAX(pd.date) AS marketcap_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON si.symbol = pd.symbol WHERE si.biotechnology = TRUE GROUP BY si.symbol, si.name ORDER BY marketCap DESC LIMIT 25), recent_revenue AS (SELECT e.symbol, MAX(e.date) AS revenue_date, MAX(e.revenue) AS revenue FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN top_biotech tb ON e.symbol = tb.symbol GROUP BY e.symbol) SELECT tb.symbol, tb.name, tb.marketCap, tb.marketcap_date, rr.revenue, rr.revenue_date, AVG(rr.revenue) OVER () AS avg_revenue FROM top_biotech tb JOIN recent_revenue rr ON tb.symbol = rr.symbol ORDER BY tb.marketCap DESC"
}
