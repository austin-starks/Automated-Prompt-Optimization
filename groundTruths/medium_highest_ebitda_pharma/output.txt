To find the pharmaceutical stocks with the highest EBITDA, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information.
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed.
3. Join the `stockindustries` and `earnings` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `earnings` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary.
5. Perform filters as necessary.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero).
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default).
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.fiscalYear, e.ebitda FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e ON si.symbol = e.symbol WHERE si.pharmaceuticals = TRUE AND e.fiscalYear = (SELECT MAX(fiscalYear) FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE symbol = si.symbol) ORDER BY e.ebitda DESC LIMIT 25"
}
