I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the top 5 stocks in the financial services industry by market cap, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed
3. Join the `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` and `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `price_data` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary
5. Perform filters as necessary
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates)
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero)
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default)
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, pd.date, pd.marketCap FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON si.symbol = pd.symbol WHERE si.financialServices = TRUE AND pd.date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` WHERE symbol = si.symbol) ORDER BY pd.marketCap DESC LIMIT 5"
}
