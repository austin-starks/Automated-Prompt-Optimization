To find the total free cash flow for Microsoft for the latest fiscal year, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the latest fiscal year data for Microsoft from the `earnings` table.
2. Filter the data to include only entries for Microsoft (symbol: MSFT).
3. Sum the free cash flow values for the entire fiscal year.
4. Ensure the query avoids common errors such as ambiguous column names and unnecessary subqueries.
5. Limit the results to 1 to get the most recent data.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT symbol, fiscalYear, SUM(freeCashFlow) AS total_free_cash_flow FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE symbol = 'MSFT' GROUP BY symbol, fiscalYear ORDER BY fiscalYear DESC LIMIT 1"
}
