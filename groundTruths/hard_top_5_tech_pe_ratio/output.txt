I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the top 5 technology stocks by market cap and their PE ratios (ttm), we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed
3. Join the `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` and `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for stockindustries (if applicable), the date field(s) for price_data (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries
4. Perform calculations if necessary
5. Perform filters as necessary
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates)
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero)
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default)
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_market_cap AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` WHERE marketCap IS NOT NULL GROUP BY symbol) SELECT si.symbol, si.name, pd.marketCap, pd.priceToEarningsRatioTTM, pd.date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN latest_market_cap lmc ON si.symbol = lmc.symbol JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON lmc.symbol = pd.symbol AND lmc.max_date = pd.date WHERE si.technology = TRUE ORDER BY pd.marketCap DESC LIMIT 5"
}
