To find EV (Electric Vehicle) stocks with a gross profit margin above 50%, we need to:
1. Filter for EV companies using the `electricVehicle` field in the `stockindustries` table.
2. Join this with the `earnings` table to get the financial metrics.
3. Filter for companies with a gross profit margin above 50%.
4. Ensure we're using the most recent financial data for each company.
5. Include relevant fields such as symbol, name, date, and gross profit margin.
6. Order the results by gross profit margin in descending order to see the highest margins first.
7. Limit the number of results to 25 (our default limit).
8. Avoid division by zero errors (not applicable in this case as we're not performing divisions).
9. Group by symbol to ensure we don't have duplicate entries for companies.
10. Use appropriate timestamp operations for date filtering.
Now I will generate the query:
This query does the following:
1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) to get the latest financial data date for each company.
2. Joins the `stockindustries`, `earnings`, and our CTE to get the required data.
3. Filters for EV companies and those with gross profit margin above 50%.
4. Orders the results by gross profit margin in descending order.
5. Limits the results to 25 companies.
6. Includes the symbol, name, date of the financial data, and the gross profit margin.
7. Uses appropriate joins and filters to ensure we're getting the most recent data for each company.
8. Avoids common errors by using proper grouping in the CTE and joining correctly.
9. Doesn't require additional calculations as gross profit margin is already provided in the `earnings` table.
10. Uses the boolean `electricVehicle` field to accurately identify EV companies.
This query will provide a list of EV companies with gross profit margins above 50%, showing their latest reported margins in descending order.
