I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the top 5 pharmaceutical stocks by market cap and their latest gross profits, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed
3. Join the `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` and `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `price_data` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary
5. Perform filters as necessary
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates)
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero)
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default)
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_market_cap AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date, MAX(marketCap) AS marketCap FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` WHERE symbol IN (SELECT symbol FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` WHERE pharmaceuticals = TRUE) GROUP BY symbol), latest_gross_profit AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date, MAX(grossProfit) AS grossProfit FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE symbol IN (SELECT symbol FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` WHERE pharmaceuticals = TRUE) GROUP BY symbol) SELECT si.symbol, si.name, lm.marketCap, lgp.grossProfit FROM latest_market_cap lm JOIN latest_gross_profit lgp ON lm.symbol = lgp.symbol JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON lm.symbol = si.symbol ORDER BY lm.marketCap DESC LIMIT 5"
}
