To find Tesla's free cash flow, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the most recent free cash flow data for Tesla from the `earnings` table.
2. Ensure we are looking at the latest available entry for Tesla.
3. Join the `earnings` table with the `stockindustries` table to include the company name.
4. Perform filters to ensure we only get data for Tesla.
5. Group stocks if necessary (not needed in this case).
6. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero) (not needed in this case).
7. Limit the number of results to 1 to get the most recent data.
8. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.date, e.freeCashFlow FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON e.symbol = si.symbol WHERE si.symbol = 'TSLA' ORDER BY e.date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
