I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the average gross profit margin of the top 10 cloud computing stocks by market cap, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to identify the top 10 cloud computing stocks by market cap. This will involve joining the `stockindustries` and `price_data` tables to filter for cloud computing companies and get their most recent market cap.
2. Join the result of step 1 with the `earnings` table to get the most recent gross profit margin data for these companies.
3. Calculate the average gross profit margin for these top 10 cloud computing stocks.
4. Ensure we're using the most recent data available for both market cap and gross profit margin.
5. Filter for cloud computing stocks using the `cloudComputing` field in the `stockindustries` table.
6. Use appropriate aggregation functions (MAX for market cap and date, MAX for gross profit margin to get the most recent value) to avoid errors related to non-aggregated columns.
7. Group by symbol in subqueries to ensure we're getting one entry per company and avoiding duplicates.
8. Include all relevant fields: symbol, name, market cap, gross profit margin, and dates in the results.
9. Limit the inner query to 10 results to get only the top 10 cloud computing stocks by market cap.
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH top_cloud_computing AS (SELECT si.symbol, si.name, MAX(pd.marketCap) AS marketCap, MAX(pd.date) AS marketcap_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON si.symbol = pd.symbol WHERE si.cloudComputing = TRUE GROUP BY si.symbol, si.name ORDER BY marketCap DESC LIMIT 10), recent_gpm AS (SELECT e.symbol, MAX(e.date) AS gpm_date, MAX(e.grossProfitMargin) AS grossProfitMargin FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN top_cloud_computing tcc ON e.symbol = tcc.symbol GROUP BY e.symbol) SELECT tcc.symbol, tcc.name, tcc.marketCap, tcc.marketcap_date, rg.grossProfitMargin, rg.gpm_date, AVG(rg.grossProfitMargin) OVER () AS avg_gross_profit_margin FROM top_cloud_computing tcc JOIN recent_gpm rg ON tcc.symbol = rg.symbol ORDER BY tcc.marketCap DESC"
}
