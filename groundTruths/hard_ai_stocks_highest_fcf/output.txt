I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the stocks in the artificial intelligence sector that had the highest free cash flow in the last quarter, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed
3. Join the `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` and `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `price_data` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries
4. Perform calculations if necessary
5. Perform filters as necessary
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates)
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero)
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default)
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_quarter AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE fiscalPeriod = 'Q4' GROUP BY symbol) SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.date, e.freeCashFlow FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN latest_quarter lq ON si.symbol = lq.symbol JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e ON lq.symbol = e.symbol AND lq.max_date = e.date WHERE si.artificialIntelligence = TRUE ORDER BY e.freeCashFlow DESC LIMIT 25"
}
