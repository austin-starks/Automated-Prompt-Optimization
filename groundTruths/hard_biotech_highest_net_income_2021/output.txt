I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the biotechnology stocks with the highest net income in 2021, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed
3. Join the `stockindustries` and `earnings` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for stockindustries (if applicable), the date field(s) for price_data (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries
4. Perform calculations if necessary
5. Perform filters as necessary
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates)
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero)
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default)
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, SUM(e.netIncome) AS total_net_income, e.fiscalYear FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e ON si.symbol = e.symbol WHERE si.biotechnology = TRUE AND e.fiscalYear = 2021 GROUP BY si.symbol, si.name, e.fiscalYear ORDER BY total_net_income DESC LIMIT 25"
}
