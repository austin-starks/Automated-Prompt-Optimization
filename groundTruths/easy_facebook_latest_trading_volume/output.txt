To find Meta's (formerly Facebook) latest trading volume, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the most recent trading volume data for Meta (symbol: META).
2. Join the `price_data` table to get the necessary fields.
3. Perform filters to ensure we only get data for Meta.
4. Order the results by date in descending order to get the most recent data.
5. Limit the number of results to 1 to get the most recent data.
6. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT symbol, date, tradingVolume FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` WHERE symbol = 'META' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
