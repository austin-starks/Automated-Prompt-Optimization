To find the free cash flow of the top 5 retail stocks, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the latest free cash flow data for each retail stock.
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed to ensure we have the most recent data.
3. Join the `stockindustries` and `earnings` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `earnings` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary (not needed in this case).
5. Perform filters to ensure we only get data for retail stocks.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero) (not needed in this case).
9. Limit the number of results to 5 to get the top 5 retail stocks.
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_fcf AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE freeCashFlow IS NOT NULL GROUP BY symbol) SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.date, e.freeCashFlow FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN latest_fcf lf ON e.symbol = lf.symbol AND e.date = lf.max_date JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON e.symbol = si.symbol WHERE si.retail = TRUE ORDER BY e.freeCashFlow DESC LIMIT 5"
}
