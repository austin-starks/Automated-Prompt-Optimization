I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the total equity of the top 5 software companies, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed.
3. Join the `stockindustries` and `earnings` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `earnings` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary.
5. Perform filters as necessary.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero).
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default).
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_equity AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE totalEquity IS NOT NULL GROUP BY symbol) SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.totalEquity, e.date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN latest_equity le ON e.symbol = le.symbol AND e.date = le.max_date JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON e.symbol = si.symbol WHERE si.software = TRUE ORDER BY e.totalEquity DESC LIMIT 5"
}
