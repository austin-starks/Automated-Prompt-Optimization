I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the top 5 pharmaceutical stocks by EBITDA and their latest revenues, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed.
3. Join the `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` table with the `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` table to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for stockindustries (if applicable), the date field(s) for price_data (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary.
5. Perform filters as necessary.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero).
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default).
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_earnings AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS latest_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` GROUP BY symbol) SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.ebitda, e.revenue, e.date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN latest_earnings le ON si.symbol = le.symbol JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e ON le.symbol = e.symbol AND le.latest_date = e.date WHERE si.pharmaceuticals = TRUE ORDER BY e.ebitda DESC LIMIT 5"
}
