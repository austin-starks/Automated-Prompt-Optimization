To find Cisco's latest earnings per share (EPS), we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the latest earnings data for Cisco from the `earnings` table.
2. Filter the data to include only entries for Cisco (symbol: CSCO).
3. Select the most recent fiscal year and period to ensure we have the latest data.
4. Join the `earnings` table with the `stockindustries` table to get the company name.
5. Include the date of the latest earnings data to ensure accuracy.
6. Avoid common errors such as ambiguous column names and unnecessary subqueries.
7. Limit the results to 1 to get the most recent data.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.fiscalYear, e.fiscalPeriod, e.earningsPerShareBasic AS EPS, e.date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON e.symbol = si.symbol WHERE si.symbol = 'CSCO' ORDER BY e.date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
