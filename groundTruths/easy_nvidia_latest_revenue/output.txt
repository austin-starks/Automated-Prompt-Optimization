To find NVIDIA's latest revenue, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the latest revenue data for NVIDIA from the `earnings` table.
2. Ensure we are looking at the most recent fiscal year and fiscal period for NVIDIA.
3. Join the `earnings` table with the `stockindustries` table to get the company name.
4. Perform filters to ensure we only get data for NVIDIA.
5. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
6. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero).
7. Limit the number of results to 1 to get the most recent data.
8. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.fiscalYear, e.fiscalPeriod, e.revenue FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON e.symbol = si.symbol WHERE si.symbol = 'NVDA' ORDER BY e.date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
