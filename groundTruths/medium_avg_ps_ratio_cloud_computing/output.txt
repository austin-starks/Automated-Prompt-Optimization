To find the average price to sales ratio of the top 5 cloud computing stocks, we need to:
1. Identify cloud computing stocks using the `stockindustries` table.
2. Get the most recent price to sales ratio data from the `price_data` table.
3. Rank the cloud computing stocks by market cap to determine the top 5.
4. Calculate the average price to sales ratio for these top 5 stocks.
5. Ensure we're using the most recent data available.
6. Join the necessary tables to combine industry classification with financial metrics.
7. Group by symbol to avoid duplicates and ensure we get one entry per company.
8. Use appropriate aggregation functions to avoid errors with non-aggregated columns.
9. Limit the results to the top 5 stocks by market cap.
10. Include all relevant fields: symbol, name, market cap, price to sales ratio, and the date of the data.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH top_cloud_stocks AS (SELECT si.symbol, si.name, MAX(pd.marketCap) AS marketCap, MAX(pd.date) AS latest_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON si.symbol = pd.symbol WHERE si.cloudComputing = TRUE GROUP BY si.symbol, si.name ORDER BY marketCap DESC LIMIT 5), latest_metrics AS (SELECT tcs.symbol, tcs.name, tcs.marketCap, tcs.latest_date, pd.priceToSalesRatioTTM FROM top_cloud_stocks tcs JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON tcs.symbol = pd.symbol AND tcs.latest_date = pd.date) SELECT symbol, name, marketCap, latest_date, priceToSalesRatioTTM, AVG(priceToSalesRatioTTM) OVER () AS avg_price_to_sales_ratio FROM latest_metrics ORDER BY marketCap DESC"
}
