To find the current market cap of Tesla, we need to:
1. Identify Tesla's stock symbol (TSLA) from the `stockindustries` table.
2. Retrieve the most recent market cap data from the `price_data` table.
3. Join the `stockindustries` and `price_data` tables to get both the company name and market cap.
4. Filter for Tesla specifically.
5. Ensure we're getting the most recent data by using the MAX(date) for the price data.
6. No complex calculations are needed, as market cap is directly available.
7. No grouping is necessary since we're only looking at one stock.
8. No need for additional filters to avoid errors like division by zero.
9. Limit to 1 result since we're only interested in Tesla.
10. Include the date of the market cap data to show when it was last updated.

Now I will generate the query:

{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, pd.date, pd.marketCap FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON si.symbol = pd.symbol WHERE si.symbol = 'TSLA' AND pd.date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` WHERE symbol = 'TSLA') LIMIT 1"
}
