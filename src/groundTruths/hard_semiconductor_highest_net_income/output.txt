I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find which semiconductor stocks had the highest net income for the fiscal year 2020, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column netIncome which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed.
3. Join the `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` table with the `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` table to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for stockindustries (if applicable), the date field(s) for earnings (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary.
5. Perform filters as necessary.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero).
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default).
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH semiconductor_earnings AS (SELECT symbol, SUM(netIncome) AS total_net_income FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE fiscalYear = 2020 GROUP BY symbol), semiconductor_stocks AS (SELECT si.symbol, si.name FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si WHERE si.semiconductor = TRUE) SELECT ss.symbol, ss.name, se.total_net_income FROM semiconductor_earnings se JOIN semiconductor_stocks ss ON se.symbol = ss.symbol ORDER BY se.total_net_income DESC LIMIT 10"
}
