To find Intel's total assets, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the most recent total assets data for Intel from the `earnings` table.
2. Ensure we are looking at the latest available entry for Intel.
3. Filter for Intel's symbol, which is "INTC".
4. Include the date of the total assets value to ensure we have the most recent data.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS date, totalAssets FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE symbol = 'INTC' GROUP BY symbol, totalAssets ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
