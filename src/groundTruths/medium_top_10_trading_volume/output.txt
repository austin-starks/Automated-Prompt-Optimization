To find the top 10 stocks by trading volume, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the latest trading volume data for each stock from the `price_data` table.
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed to ensure we have the most recent data.
3. Join the `price_data` table to get the necessary fields.
4. Perform calculations if necessary (not needed in this case).
5. Perform filters to ensure we only get data for the most recent date.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero) (not needed in this case).
9. Limit the number of results to 10 to get the top stocks by trading volume.
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT symbol, date, tradingVolume FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` WHERE date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data`) ORDER BY tradingVolume DESC LIMIT 10"
}
