To find the total liabilities of Apple, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the most recent total liabilities data for Apple from the `earnings` table.
2. Ensure we are looking at the latest available entry for Apple.
3. Join the `earnings` table with the `stockindustries` table to include the company name.
4. Perform filters to ensure we only get data for Apple.
5. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
6. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero) (not needed in this case).
7. Limit the number of results to 1 to get the most recent data.
8. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.date, e.totalLiabilities FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON e.symbol = si.symbol WHERE si.symbol = 'AAPL' ORDER BY e.date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
