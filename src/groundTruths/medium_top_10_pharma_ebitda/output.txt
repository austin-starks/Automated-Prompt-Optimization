To find the latest EBITDA values for the top 10 pharmaceutical stocks, we need to:
1. Identify pharmaceutical stocks using the `stockindustries` table.
2. Get the most recent market cap data for these stocks from the `price_data` table to determine the top 10.
3. Retrieve the latest EBITDA values from the `earnings` table for these top 10 stocks.
4. Join the necessary tables to combine all the required information.
5. Ensure we're getting the most recent data for both market cap and EBITDA.
6. Order the results by market cap to get the top 10 pharmaceutical stocks.
7. Include all relevant fields: symbol, name, date of market cap, market cap value, date of EBITDA, and EBITDA value.
8. Limit the results to 10 stocks.
9. Use appropriate subqueries and joins to avoid errors related to aggregation and grouping.
10. Ensure we're not getting duplicate entries for each stock.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH pharma_stocks AS (SELECT symbol, name FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` WHERE pharmaceuticals = TRUE), latest_market_cap AS (SELECT ps.symbol, ps.name, MAX(pd.date) AS market_cap_date, MAX(pd.marketCap) AS market_cap FROM pharma_stocks ps JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON ps.symbol = pd.symbol GROUP BY ps.symbol, ps.name ORDER BY market_cap DESC LIMIT 10), latest_ebitda AS (SELECT e.symbol, MAX(e.date) AS ebitda_date, MAX(e.ebitda) AS ebitda FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN latest_market_cap lmc ON e.symbol = lmc.symbol GROUP BY e.symbol) SELECT lmc.symbol, lmc.name, lmc.market_cap_date, lmc.market_cap, le.ebitda_date, le.ebitda FROM latest_market_cap lmc JOIN latest_ebitda le ON lmc.symbol = le.symbol ORDER BY lmc.market_cap DESC"
}
