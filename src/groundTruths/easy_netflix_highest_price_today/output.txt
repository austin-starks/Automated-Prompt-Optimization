I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find Netflix's highest price today, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the latest price data for Netflix from the `price_data` table.
2. Filter the data to include only entries for Netflix.
3. Select the highest price for Netflix from the most recent data available.
4. Ensure the query avoids common errors such as ambiguous column names and unnecessary subqueries.
5. Limit the results to 1 to get the most recent data.
6. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT symbol, date, highestPrice AS price FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` WHERE symbol = 'NFLX' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
