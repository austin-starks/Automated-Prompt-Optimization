To find the price to book value ratio for Google, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the most recent price data for Google from the `price_data` table.
2. Join the `price_data` table with the `stockindustries` table to get the company name.
3. Filter for the symbol corresponding to Google (GOOGL or GOOG).
4. Ensure we get the latest available data by ordering by date in descending order and limiting the results to 1.
5. Include the relevant fields: symbol, name, date, and price to book value ratio.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, pd.date, pd.priceToBookValueTTM AS price_to_book_value_ratio FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON pd.symbol = si.symbol WHERE pd.symbol IN ('GOOGL', 'GOOG') ORDER BY pd.date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
