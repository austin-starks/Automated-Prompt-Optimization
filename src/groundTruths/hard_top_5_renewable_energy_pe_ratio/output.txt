I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the top 5 stocks in the renewable energy sector by market cap and their PE ratios, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed.
3. Join the `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` and `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `price_data` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary.
5. Perform filters as necessary.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero).
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default).
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_market_cap AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date, MAX(marketCap) AS marketCap FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` WHERE date <= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() GROUP BY symbol), renewable_energy_stocks AS (SELECT si.symbol, si.name FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si WHERE si.renewableEnergy = TRUE) SELECT res.symbol, res.name, lmc.marketCap, pd.priceToEarningsRatioTTM FROM renewable_energy_stocks res JOIN latest_market_cap lmc ON res.symbol = lmc.symbol JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd ON res.symbol = pd.symbol AND lmc.max_date = pd.date ORDER BY lmc.marketCap DESC LIMIT 5"
}
