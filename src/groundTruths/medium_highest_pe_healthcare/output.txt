To find healthcare stocks with the highest price to earnings ratio, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information.
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed.
3. Join the `stockindustries` and `price_data` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `price_data` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary.
5. Perform filters as necessary.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero).
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default).
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_price_data AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` GROUP BY symbol) SELECT si.symbol, si.name, pd.date, pd.priceToEarningsRatioTTM FROM `my_project.my_dataset.price_data` pd JOIN latest_price_data lpd ON pd.symbol = lpd.symbol AND pd.date = lpd.max_date JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON pd.symbol = si.symbol WHERE si.healthcare = TRUE ORDER BY pd.priceToEarningsRatioTTM DESC LIMIT 25"
}
