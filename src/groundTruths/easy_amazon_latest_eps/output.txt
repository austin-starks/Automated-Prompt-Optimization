I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find the latest earnings per share (EPS) for Amazon, we need to:
1. **Filter for Amazon**: Use the `earnings` table to filter for Amazon using its symbol (AMZN).
2. **Ensure Latest Data**: Order the results by date in descending order to get the most recent data.
3. **Limit Results**: Limit the results to 1 to ensure we only get the latest entry.
4. **Include Relevant Fields**: Select the symbol, date, and earnings per share (EPS) fields.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT symbol, date, earningsPerShareBasic AS EPS FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE symbol = 'AMZN' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
