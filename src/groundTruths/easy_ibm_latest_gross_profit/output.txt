To find IBM's latest gross profit, we need to:
1. Generate a subquery to get the most recent gross profit data for IBM from the `earnings` table.
2. Ensure we are looking at the latest available data by using the maximum date for IBM.
3. Join the `earnings` table with the `stockindustries` table to include the company name.
4. Filter for IBM specifically by its symbol.
5. Group by the symbol to avoid duplicates.
6. Avoid common errors such as ambiguous column names and unnecessary subqueries.
7. Limit the results to 1 to get the most recent data.
8. Include all relevant fields: symbol, name, date, and gross profit.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.date, e.grossProfit FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si ON e.symbol = si.symbol WHERE si.symbol = 'IBM' ORDER BY e.date DESC LIMIT 1"
}
