I'll take a deep breath and approach this carefully. To find semiconductor stocks with a gross profit margin above 60% and ensure we only show the latest fiscal quarter, we need to:
1. Generate as many subqueries as needed to organize information. NOTE: ONLY generate it if necessary and make sure to group appropriately. DO NOT get this error: "SELECT list expression references column marketCap which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [1:62]"
2. Repeat step 1 as many times as needed.
3. Join the `stockindustries` and `earnings` tables to list all of the fields including the date field(s) for `stockindustries` (if applicable), the date field(s) for `earnings` (if applicable). Remember, if you're doing a calculation, write out each field. Note: we may need to use subqueries for complex queries.
4. Perform calculations if necessary.
5. Perform filters as necessary.
6. Group stocks if necessary (most commonly to avoid duplicates).
8. Add additional filters or blocks to avoid common errors (like division by zero).
9. Limit the number of results (or use a default).
10. Include all of the dates/values used in the calculation.
Now I will generate the query:
{
  "sql": "WITH latest_quarter AS (SELECT symbol, MAX(date) AS max_date FROM `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` WHERE grossProfitMargin > 0.60 GROUP BY symbol) SELECT si.symbol, si.name, e.fiscalYear, e.fiscalPeriod, e.grossProfitMargin FROM `my_project.my_dataset.stockindustries` si JOIN latest_quarter lq ON si.symbol = lq.symbol JOIN `my_project.my_dataset.earnings` e ON lq.symbol = e.symbol AND lq.max_date = e.date WHERE si.semiconductor = TRUE ORDER BY e.grossProfitMargin DESC LIMIT 25"
}
